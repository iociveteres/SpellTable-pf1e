Unlike an atonement spell, absolution can’t reverse alignment change or the effects of willing transgressions, induce a creature to change its alignment, or restore class abilities lost because of misdeeds performed in the past. Absolution automatically works if the caster and the target share the same alignment or the same patron deity. If they don’t, but their alignments are within one step of each other, absolution has a 5% chance of success per caster level. If neither of these is true, the spell automatically fails.

To absorb a rune, you must be aware of the rune’s existence (but need not know the details of what it actually does) and then succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the caster level of the spell affect being absorbed) as you touch the rune in question. If you fail this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the roll by 5 or more.
If you succeed at the caster level check, the rune is removed from the surface it was originally placed upon and duplicated on the cloth of a silk glove worn on your hand. The rune remains located on the glove’s palm in an inert state for up to 1 minute per caster level. As a standard action taken at any time during that duration, you can transfer the rune to another surface similar to the one it was originally placed upon, at which point the rune’s function either returns to normal or dissipates harmlessly as if successfully dispelled (your choice). If the spell’s duration expires before you place the rune on a new surface, the absorbed rune dissipates harmlessly.
Absorb rune I affects only runes whose effects are equivalent to a spell of 3rd level or lower. An attempt to use absorb rune I on a more powerful effect automatically triggers the rune when you touch it." source="Adventurer's Guide pg. 60">Absorb a magic rune up to 3rd level, which can be moved or dispelled</td>

The spell’s area of effect is often a sphere, although you can shape it to be smaller than the maximum area or to exclude certain adjacent areas or objects (for example, if you are warding a specific structure, or if you are roughly warding the front lines of a battlefield). This spell’s area is also up to 40 feet in height, so flying creatures benefit as long as they are in this area of effect.
Creatures and objects in the warded area gain damage reduction 20/magic against ranged weapons.

If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect’s caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response.
While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud’s original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath’s area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud’s original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends this spell. If you do not exhale the cloud before this spell’s duration expires, you suffer the cloud’s effects and automatically fail any saving throw to resist it." source="Advanced Race Guide pg. 160">Completely inhale a cloud-like effect, keeping it stored harmlessly in your body</td>

A character attempting to intimidate your targets is instead perceived as having exaggerated facial features or babbling and awkward speech. Effects that impose fear conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to scare them.
Absurdity protects your targets from gaining lesser fear conditions (spooked, shaken, and scared), granting them immunity to spooked and a 50% chance to negate shaken or scared conditions instead of gaining them from any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any other effect related to a spell or ability that generates fear (such as dying from a phantasmal killer) affects them normally, and effects that ignore immunity to fear also ignore absurdity.
However, target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats; they take a –10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a –2 penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn’t prevent spells or effects that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like anticipate peril or find traps) from alerting the affected character to danger." source="Horror Adventures pg. 108">Threats seem like a ridiculous farce</td>

Each creature with whom you attempt to leverage your newfound authority receives a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. Otherwise, it treats you as it would its direct superior. Creatures with different direct superiors see you in different ways, which can potentially lead to conflicts that allow additional saving throws (for instance, if a cook sees you as the head chef, he might be quite perplexed to see the vizier treating you as if you were the king)." source="Inner Sea Races pg. 218">Creatures believe you are their direct superior</td>
