                <p>This site was born from procrastination over my thesis and completed out of love — 
                though with Pathfinder now it's a love-hate relationship.<br>
                I've started building it several times with React, but it felt too complex for the task. 
                Then, I came across a blog post about how much can be achieved with just HTML, CSS, and 
                vanilla JavaScript, and leveraged these tools.<br>
                I hope you find this site enjoyable to use and helpful in your wizardly research.</p>

                <p>I'm currently working on a character sheet for Black Crusade system. I don't like how slow roll20 is, 
                and character sheets here either have poor design or are somewhat broken. I recommend systems of this family, 
                they are works of great design and have few flaws. Black Crusade especially, it has a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fvzFprwjog_1xdiGrPzUK4__daAKFdUk/view">fun fan mod</a>, 
                with content from other books and rebalances for the better, but unfortunately, available only in russian.<br>
                This character sheet will require proper back-end, and when I will host it, I'll also host this site. 
                GitHub Pages are fine, but cache lives only for 10 minutes and it can not be configurated. I feel 
                awkward by sending 1 Mb of json if you visit site another day.</p>
                <p>I’ve also thought about making a similar site for Pathfinder 2e or D&D 5e if this one gets popular and picks up donations. No promises, though.</p>
